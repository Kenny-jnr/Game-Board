I am acting as a member of a team implementing a board game where players have sets of game pieces fighting each other.
The board contains member variables that track the name of the player that owns this piece, and the type of GamePiece it is (the three options are Warrior, Scout, or Wizard).

Each piece has a different speed and power that helps them in battle. So essentially this is a board game that a user can use various game pieces for the board game.
